## link1 is the part you dirctly write to database
## link2 is the part where you write to a textfile (dump file)
## later after fixed time we write it to database


In my assignment,
The time taken by the the model1 writing directly to the database is taking much less time compared
to dumping in to other file and reading it later on.
